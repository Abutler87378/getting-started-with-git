## Getting Git.

If you're working on a Raspberry Pi, then congratulations: Git already is installed in Raspbian by default. If you're using Mac OS, then you can follow [this quick guide](mac-install.md) to installing Git and then return here to learn how to use it. If you're on Windows, then you can follow [this guide to install Git shell](windows-install.md). Lastly, if you're on Linux, and you don't have Git installed, then you can just use your package manager to grab the software. Something like this should work:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```
