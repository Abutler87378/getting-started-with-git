# Installing Git on Windows

The easiest way to install Git on Windows is to use GitHub's application. You'll want to go ahead and set up an account with GitHub now, to make things easier later on.

1. Register for a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join?source=header-home), and just choose the free plan.

1. Then head on over to [desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) and click on the Download button to download the GitHub app.

1. Once the file has downloaded, double click on the `.exe` file and follow the onscreen instructions to install. Near the end of the registration, you'll want to use your GitHub credentials to login, and then proceed through the rest of the steps.

1. Once the setup has completed, you should see two new icons on your Desktop and Application Menu.

1. Although you can use the graphical version of the GitHub app, if you want to follow the rest of the [worksheet](worksheet.md), then you can simple use the **Git Shell** app, which is a Command Line Interface to using Git. This way you'll feel comfortable working on other Operating Systems, and also learn a little bash.

1. As the GitHub app has configured your username and email address, you can skip the **## Setting up Git** section of the main worksheet.
